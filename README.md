<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>TensorFlow</h3>
<p>Tensorflow is an open source platform that is used for machine learning. The architecture of Tensor is three parts, 1). Preprocess data, 2). build model, 3). train the model. Tensorflow can be ran on many different platfroms such as Desktops(windows, linux, etc), cloud web services and mobile devices.</p>
    
<h3>Keras</h3>
<p>Keras is a high level neural networks API thats written in Python. It can be ran on Tensorflow, Theano and CNTK. Keras API was "designed for human beings, not machines". Model is the core Keras data structure(two main types, Sequential model and Model class).</p>

<h3>Mnist dataset</h3>
<p>MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a dataset of handwritten digits. The digits ranges fro 0 - 9 meaning 10 patterns. MNIST is extensively used for classification and image recognition tasks.</p>
